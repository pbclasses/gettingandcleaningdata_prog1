   run_analysis.R:  an R script that will load datafiles from the 
                    UCI HAR Dataset and produce a tidy dataset consisting
                    of the average means and standard deviations of various
                    measurements grouped by subject id and activity

When running the R script, the working directory should have both the
train and test directories. To run the script, type:
   source("run_analysis.R")

The script will create a tidy dataset file called "datasetMean.txt" which
has the following columns:
   Subject: person being measured, integer between 1 and 30
   Activity: action being performed, can be walking, walking_upstairs, walking_downstairs, sitting, standing, or laying
